## Results

- Dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence resulting from increased ROS showed a perinuclear distribution (Fig. 1A), consistent with the ROS increase in mitochondria during hyperglycemia.
- Time course experiments revealed that ROS increased within 15 min and decreased to the normal level in 60 min (Fig. 1B), indicating that HG incubation produces a *transient* increase in ROS.
- The HG-induced ROS production was accompanied by a marked change in mitochondrial morphology. Normal tubular mitochondria became short and small within 15 min, indicating mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1C). The Mitochondrial Fission Protein **DLP1** Mediates HG-Induced Mitochondrial Fragmentation.

- Both mitochondrial morphology change and ROS increase in HG conditions require glucose metabolism. Early morphological change of mitochondria is necessary for increased respiration in HG conditions.
- Mitochondrial Pyruvate Uptake Is Necessary for HG-Induced ROS Increase but Not for Mitochondrial Fragmentation.
- Not only inhibiting fission but also increasing fusion of mitochondria prevents HG-induced ROS increase

ROS levels fluctuate during prolonged exposure to HG conditions. Inhibition of DLP1 Function Blocks HG-Induced ROS Fluctuation.

## Materials

The cell lines Clone 9 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CRL-1439] and H9c2 (ATCC CRL-1446) were maintained in Ham’s F-12K and DMEM plus 10% FBS.
