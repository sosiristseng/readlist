Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by two sets of opposed processes: mitochondrial fusion and fission, and mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation (including mitophagy), as well as processes such as intracellular transport.

Mitochondrial dynamics vary based on developmental stage and age, cell type, environmental factors, and genetic background.

## Human disease genes involved in mitochondrial dynamics

Mitochondria fuse in a process that requires inner- and outer-mitochondrial membrane (IMM and OMM) GTPases. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by several proteins, but the GTPase Dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1) is the most central. Overall, fusion and fission maintain mtDNA copy number, integrity (i.e., removal of damaged and mutated mtDNA), and distribution.

(`Table 1`)

- MFN2  (Charcot-Marie Tooth Neuropathy type 2A): Outer membrane fusion
- OPA1  (Dominant Optic Atrophy): Inner membrane fusion.
- DRP1  (Neuro-degeneration and early death): Fission.
- PARK2 (Parkinson’s Disease): Mitophagy.
- PINK1 (Parkinson’s Disease): Mitophagy.

## Time scale

In cell culture, fusion and fission can occur within minutes or even seconds, particularly in the case of rapid stress-induced fission or transient, partial fusion events described as “kiss-and-run” (Dalmasso et al. 2017; Duarte et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2009). At the cellular level, mixing of contents between mitochondria can occur within an hour (Youle and van der Bliek 2012).

The rate of movement of mitochondria in the cells, estimated to be ~0.1–0.2 μm/second in the perinuclear region and up to ~0.7 μm/second in the cytosol and in axons (Dalmasso et al. 2017).

## Morphology in different cells

We summarize some of the better-characterized patterns; a number of specific examples are reviewed by Kuznetsov et al. (Kuznetsov et al. 2009).

**Stem cells**: In stem cells, mitochondria are fragmented and spherical, predominantly perinuclearly located, and exhibit less oxidative phosphorylation, more glycolysis.

**Dividing cells**: In dividing cells, mitochondria tend to fuse during G1-S stages, presumably to provide energy for division, and divide prior to mitosis, presumably to enable distribution into daughter cells (Mishra and Chan 2014).

**Cardiomyocytes**: Mitochondria in cardiomyocytes are relatively lacking in dynamics and non-networked, yet still express fusion and fission proteins which appear to have important quality-control functions.

**T cells**: Mitochondria in differentiating T cells employ undergo both biogenesis and dramatic metabolic remodeling (Ron-Harel et al. 2016).

**Cancer cells**: Inhibiting mitochondrial fission can impede cancerous processes (Rehman et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2013).

## Fission/fusion factors

Mitochondrial fusion and fission are regulated transcriptionally and non-transcriptionally (including proteolytic degradation and post-translational modification of proteins) by a multitude of factors (Hoppins 2014; Mishra and Chan 2016; Toyama et al. 2016; Van der Bliek et al. 2014; Willems et al. 2015)
- metabolic status
- energetic status
- mitochondrial membrane potential
- redox status
- cellular stress

## Biogenesis

Regulation of mitobiogenesis varies among tissues, but often involves the (Ploumi et al. 2017)
- peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)
- AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase
- sirtuins (e.g. SIRT1)
- nuclear respiratory factors (NRF1 and NRF2)
- nuclear factor-erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; also referred to as Nrf2)
- estrogen-related receptors (ERR-α, ERR-β, ERR-γ) .

## Deradation and mitophagy

Only mitophagy requires mitochondrial fission, as elongated mitochondrial are somewhat recalcitrant to mitophagy.

PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a mitochondrial kinase that accumulates on dysfunctional mitochondria and recruits and activates proteins including Parkin (PARK2), a ubiquitin ligase.

## Relationship to other mitochondrial parameters

Mitochondrial parameters are closely linked. As mentioned above, more-networked mitochondria are generally associated with higher ATP production.

Loss of MFN2 is associated with lower mitochondrial membrane potential, proton leak, glucose oxidation, and Krebs cycle activity; these same parameters are increased upon MFN2 overexpression. (Schrepfer and Scorrano 2016)

Loss of membrane potential, which contributes to mitophagy via PINK1-mediated Parkin activation, can also inhibit mitochondrial fusion and mobility. Also, loss of membrane potential leads to OPA1 degradation.

**Caveat**: Many mitodynamic responses and well as other mitochondrial and cellular functions are regulated by the same signaling cascades. e.g., AMPK.

## Mitochondrial fusion and fission as stress responses

The aim of stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion (SIMH) is to maintain OXPHOS and optimal ATP levels to adapt to mild stress (van der Bliek 2009; Youle and van der Bliek 2012)

Stressors
- Chemicals (hydrogen peroxide)
- Starvation (cAMP-activated protein kinase to phosphorylated inhibition of DRP1) : Conversely, superfluous nutrients can cause increased fragmentation (Molina et al. 2009)
- viral infection: might be part of the innate immune response

## Toxicant-induced mitochondrial fusion and fission

(`Table2`)

Specific agents (i.e., FCCP, CCCP, and 2,4-DNP) directly result in mitochondrial uncoupling and lead to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which then leads to an inhibition of fusion.
