There are also at least three metabolic enzymes that respond to cellular energy status independently of AMPK:
- phosphofructokinase (PFK)
- glycogen phosphorylase
- fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase)
all three of these energy-sensing metabolic enzymes respond primarily to AMP and ATP, rather than to ADP and ATP.

Mitochondria often occur in cells as elongated and even branched tubular networks (figure 3b), as well as in more fragmented, vesicular forms; these alternate forms exist in a dynamic equilibrium mediated by fission and fusion, and which form predominates is dependent upon conditions.

A kinaseâ€“phosphatase cycle acts as a molecular switch, reversibly switching the target protein between the dephosphorylated and phosphorylated states according to the relative catalytic activities of the kinase and phosphatase. Cells also contain other molecular switch mechanisms, including GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), which are switched between GDP-bound and GTP-bound forms.

AMP binding causes activation of AMPK by three complementary mechanisms, all of which are antagonized by ATP.

## SENSING OF GLUCOSE BY AMPK

Responses to glucose starvation need AMPK in yeast and plants.

In mammal cells, AMPK can sense glucose by a non-canonical mechanism that does not necessarily involve changes in cellular adenine nucleotide concentrations
