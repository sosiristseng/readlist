## Summary

We have taken an *in silico* approach to expand the focus of the MFRTA by including other key mitochondrial stress response pathways, as they have been observed in the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*.
These include the
- mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt)
- mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy dynamics (**no fission / fusion**)
- the relevant DAF‐16 and SKN‐1 axes
- and NAD-dependent deacetylase activities.

To integrate these pathways, we have developed a multilevel hybrid‐modeling paradigm, containing
- agent‐based elements among stochastic system‐dynamics environments of
- logically derived ordinary differential equations,

to simulate aging mitochondrial phenotypes within a population of energetically demanding cells.

## Introduction

MFRTA: mitochondrial free radical theory of aging is mediated by

- ROS (but physiological amount is beneficial)
- mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt)

The degenerative aging response is not a result of a single concrete cellular pathway, but is dependent upon specific magnitudes of multiple key mitochondrial pathways that allow for cellular senescence states and pathological phenotypes.

## Model construction

[Supporting information (pdf)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5676065/bin/ACEL-16-1244-s001.pdf)

To fill this network with realistic parameters and relevant reaction schemes for the aging nematode, we gathered a vast set of information from the literature to determine:
- mitochondria counts and mtDNA counts.
- mitochondrion‐level system‐dynamics and discrete‐event computational methods for oxidative metabolism, proteostasis, and heteroplasmic mtDNA analysis.
- cell‐level system‐dynamics computational methods surrounding the UPRmt and mitochondrial protein import
- Agent‐based principles that govern stress‐dependent cellular degeneration

The model consists of

- logically derived ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- discrete‐event (stochastic) statements

## Model performance and predictions for spontaneous functional declines

A sharp decline in tissue ATP presents itself after NAD+ levels have begun to decline (around 7500 min)

Mitochondrial dynamics, including biogenesis and selective mitophagy, were simulated, and organelle counts were tracked for an entire population of cells.

Oxidative stress levels were measured in silico as well (Fig. 5A), and closely matched spontaneous increases seen previously in C. elegans (Gruber et al., 2011).

## Endpoint changes after control of selective mitophagy

To perturb the computational model, we determined mathematical methods for introducing rapamycin or bafilomycin as regulators of mitophagy (Box S7).
