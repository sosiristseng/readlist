The key components of the machinery mediating mitochondrial fusion and fission belong to the dynamin family of GTPases that utilize GTP hydrolysis to drive mechanical work on biological membranes.

## mtDNA

All 37 genes of the mitochondrial genome, therefore, are important for OXPHOS activity, and high levels of mtDNA mutations generally result in impaired energy generation.

The vast majority of the∼1,000 proteins of the mitochondrial proteome are encodedin the nuclear genome, are synthesized in the cytosol, and must be imported into the organelle.

## Fusion

Mitochondrial fusion requires three large GTP-hydrolyzing enzymes of the dynamin superfamily. The mitofusins, `Mfn1` and `Mfn2`, are located on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Inner membrane fusion, on the other hand, is mediated by Optic Atrophy 1 (Opa1).

**KISS-AND-RUN FUSION EVENTS**
In addition to obvious fusion events, where two mitochondria clearly merge into a larger mitochondrion, mitochondrial fusion can also take place via transient, so-called kiss-and-run encounters, in which no obvious merger or structural rearrangement occurs. Apart from regulation of morphology, *content exchange* is an important function of mitochondrial fusion.

Under stress conditions,especially conditions associated with stress-induced hyperfusion, the fusion activity of the long isoform of OPA is activated by unknown mechanisms.

In addition to fusion of the inner membrane, Opa1 plays an independent role in maintainingcristae structure.

## Fission

The central mediator of mitochondrial fission is dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), also a GTPase.

Instead, Fis1 is required for some forms of mitophagy in mammal cells.

Three other outer membrane proteins—Mff, MiD49, and MiD51—have more substantialroles in recruitment of Drp1 to mitochondria.

### Fission site

- **ER**: ER tubules crossing or wrapping around the mitochondria (39). Mff, MiD49, MiD51, and Drp1 often colocalize with these ER-marked sites, where the mitochondrial tubules are constricted
- **mtDNA**: nucleoid structures


## Why fission and fusion

Regulation of Mitochondrial Morphology:

- Mitochondrial shape may directly affect the bioenergetic function of mitochondria, with elon-gated mitochondria sometimes correlated with more efficient ATP production. However, the causal connection between mitochondrial shape and bioenergetics remains unclear.
- Energy deficiency causes activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates Mff to promote mitochondrial fission.
- Although mitochondria dysfunction will often cause mitochondrial fragmentation, it does not mean that fragmented mitochondria should generally be equated to low ATP production without experimental confirmation.


(Fusion) promotes Content Exchange (homogenization)

- When mitochondrial fusion is inhibited, individual mitochondria diverge in their properties.
- Helps ameliorate the detrimental effects of heteroplasmic mtDNA
