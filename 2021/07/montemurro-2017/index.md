## Introduction

The present studies underscore the importance of taking into account the major changes in metabolism, mitochondrial network and cellular compartmental Ca2+ transients that occur in cell cycle.

## Synchronization of INS 832/13 cells at different stages of the cell cycle

## Mitochondrial morphology and function during the cell cycle

At G1/S, almost 80% of the cells had highly tubular mitochondria that became fragmented in the other phases of the cell cycle: 30% of cells in S phase and 60% of cells in G2/M had fragmented mitochondria.

There was no evidence of altered mitochondrial fusion mediated by Opa1 during the cell cycle as the ratio between long (or active) and short (or inactive) forms of **Opa1** did not appear to change (data not shown).

The fragmentation of the mitochondrial network at the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle was coincident with the activation of **Drp1** by phosphorylation at Ser616.

## Changes in subcellular Ca2+ distribution during cell cycle

The relative Ca2+ levels of the ER were stable during the transition from the G1/S to the G2/M phases of the cell cycle.

The rise in mitochondrial Ca2+ during the cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phases coincided with the increased mitochondrial respiration, presumably by activation of Ca2+-dependent dehydrogenases of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

## Fluctuations in metabolism during cell cycle

[Table1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5731404/table/t0001/)

G1/S stage: expansion of biomass and synthesis of nucleic acids
- pyruvate anaplerosis
- pentose phosphate pathway (S phase)
- high rate of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis

Increased levels of palmitate and choline, suggesting augmented fatty acid metabolism in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle.
