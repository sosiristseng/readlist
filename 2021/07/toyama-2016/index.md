Inhibition of mitochondrial fusion due to aberrant processing of Optic atrophy 1 (**OPA1**, an inner mitochondrial membrane fusion GTPase) is a proposed mechanism, but it is thought to require a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The inhibition of ETC by rotenone or antimycin A does not meet this cirteria.

AMPK is rapidly activated by mitochondrial stress and acutely triggers mitochondrial fission, at least in part via phosphorylation of mitochodnrial fission factor (MFF).
