5′ Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionary conserved serine/threonine protein kinase which integrates nutrient signaling pathways to organize energy homeostasis.

One solution for a signaling molecule to achieve multi-tasking within the differential cellular space is compartmentalization. Compartmentalization of the AMPK response could occur at three levels: regulators, effectors and AMPK itself.

## Spatiotemporal regulation of AMPK activity at specific subcellular compartments

AMPK is able to associate with endomembrane (Mitchelhill et al., 1997; Oakhill et al., 2010), at least partially explains why AMPK activity is basally higher in membrane-bound organelles.
