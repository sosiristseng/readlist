## Intro

Mitochondria attracted renovated attention of cancer treatment from a metabolic perspective
- Some mitochondrial metabolites (succinate, fumarate) are sufficient to drive oncogenesis.
- Some mitochondrial circuitries can adapt to serve bioenergetic or anabolic functions, hence endowing malignant cells with considerable metabolic plasticity

## malignant transformation

Normal cells -> cancer cells

1. mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes DNA mutations and activates potentially oncogenic signaling pathways
2. mitochondrial metabolites, including fumarate, succinate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)
3. functional deficits in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) or mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), escaping apoptosis

## tumor progression

Small tumor -> big tumor

-  A major source of ATP
-  Building blocks for anabolism via anaplerosis in the TCA cycle
-  Producing ROS
-  Resisting apoptosis signaling

Metabolic flexibility to use various other carbon sources including (but perhaps not limited to) acetate, lactate, serine and glycine as needed, and to interchangeably use glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation as the source of energy in response to fluctuating microenvironmental conditions.

Mitochondrial dynamics is also involved in the increased resistance of cancer cells to MOMP and MPT. Malignant cells cope with glucose deprivation by shifting to OXPHOS upon mitochondrial elongation secondary to dynamin 1-like (DNM1L) inhibition to increase OXPHOS capacity.

## therapeutic responses

Mitochondria are critically involved in the control of Regulated cell death (RCD) triggered by all these treatments, implying that alterations of the propensity of mitochondria to undergo MOMP or MPT underlie a majority of cases of primary and acquired resistance

## immunosurveillance

The best characterized mitochondrial product that participates in the elicitation of immune responses to dying cancer cells is extracellular ATP.
