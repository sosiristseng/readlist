## Introduction

Metabolite stability during workload changes
- calcium feed-forward: stimulatory effects have been shown to be completely saturated at the lowest physiological Ca2+ concentrations under physiological temperature and ionic conditions.
- Inorganic phosphate and ADP feedback: Pi activating complex III was capable of improving the fit of the mitochondria model to data on isolated mitochondria.

## Model
In this study, we use mathematical modeling to investigate the significance of Ca2+-mediated feed-forward versus Pi-mediated feedback mechanisms in regulating energy supply to match energy demand. The ventricular myocyte cell model used in this study is based on that of [Crampin and Smith (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1432112/).

### ATP consumption

- Na+/K+ pump (NKA): [Terkildsen et al. (2007) model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17873015/)
- SERCA: [Tran et al. 2009 model.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717298/)
- Cross-bridge cycling: [Tran et al. 2010 model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808479/)

Assuming the hydrolysis of magnesium-bound ATP (MgATP) is tightly (stoichiometrically) coupled to the enzymatic cycles of each of the three ATPases.

### ATP supply

[Beard (2005) model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1201326/)
- CAC: Activated by calcium
- Complex III: Activated by inorganic phosphate

## Results

Average steady-state values of the cytosolic metabolite and ion concentrations

Metabolite / ion changes vs. sarcomere length (SL).

## Discussion

We find that neither Ca2+- nor Pi-mediated regulation of the **dehydrogenase flux** is capable of upregulating mitochondrial ATP production rate above that of substrate availability (from MgADP and Pi). We find that this **activation of complex III**, downstream of the dehydrogenase flux, leads to increased stability of cellular metabolite concentrations.

Our model predicts that NADH concentration is not a good indicator of mitochondrial respiration rate. Our simulations suggest that the only one capable of increasing mitochondrial ATP supply above that of substrate availability, is **Pi regulation of respiratory complex III**.
