In mammals, MT-fusion events are mediated by mitochondrial proteins belonging to the family of related GTPases: Mitofusin 1 (MFN1), Mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and OPtic Atrophy 1 (OPA1). MFN1 and MFN2: outer mitochondrial membranes (MOM). OPA1: inner mitochondrial membranes (MIM). Fusion process allows contents exchange, such as mtDNA, proteins, lipids and metabolites between mitochondria, all necessary for maintaining genetic and biochemical homogeneity within the mitochondrial population. The fusion process is also well known to be important for oxidative phosphorylation activity, particularly through the regulation of mtDNA levels.

In mammals, the GTPase dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), is described to be the major effector of this process. The second class of proteins includes Fis1, Mff, MiD49 and MiD51 (FISsion 1 protein, Mitochondrial Fission Factor, and Mitochondrial Dynamics protein 49/51). Fission, on the other hand, ensures the quality control of mitochondria by facilitating the removal of damaged organelles via mitophagy, facilitates their transport along the cytoskeletal network and is essential for separating mitochondria into two daughter cells during cell division.

Human disorders associated with disturbed mitochondrial dynamics are listed in `Table 1`.


## Mitochondrial Fusion Maintain Metabolic Homeostasis during Nutritional Stress

Mild stress: SIMH response, for Stress-Induced Mitochondrial Hyperfusion response
- MT fusion during nutrient depletion protects them from autophagic degradation
- Hyperfusion also depends upon the energy sensor Sirtuin 5 (Sirt5)
- In human cells models suggesting that efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is associated with mitochondrial connectivity; hence highly interconnected network correlates with increased ATP production under different conditions.
- In the same line, AMPK activation and subsequent mTOR (Mammalian/Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin) inhibition—two major energy and nutrient sensors—have been also shown to induce MT fusion.

## Concluding Remarks: Is Autophagy Key for a Better Understanding?


The maintenance of a functional MT networking is crucial for overall cell health and homeostasis. Unhealthy MT are mostly degraded by mitophagy.

During macroautophagy (induced by several stressful conditions), mitochondria hyperfuse to escape autophagosome engulfment and so sustain cell survival.

When there is limited damage, MT can also repair itself by eliminating damaged materials via mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) that bud off and then fuse with lysosomes.
