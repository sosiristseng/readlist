In some cancers (leukemias, lymphomas, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, high OXPHOS subtype melanoma, and endometrial carcinoma), OXPHOS is upregulated for energy production, as opposed to Warburg's effect.

Ingibiting OXPHOS could alleviate tumor hypoxia and sensitize the cancer cell to treatment.
- Hypoxic cells are resistant to cancer therapy, leading to local recurrence and an increased propensity toward metastasis
- Hypoxic tumor cells are up to three times more resistant to radiotherapy.
