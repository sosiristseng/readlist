In beta cells, elevated levels of glucose causes an increase in the ratio of ATP to ADP that contributes to depolarization of the plasma membrane (PM) via inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels.

Intracellular free MgADP stimulates KATP channel activity, and it has been suggested that ADP, or the ATP/ADP ratio, is responsible for channel regulation in vivo.

Changes in [ATP]/[ADP] are tightly coupled to oscillations in intracellular free Ca2+, oxygen, and glucose consumption in pancreatic β-cells.

Two main types of [Ca2+]i oscillations in pancreatic β-cells: fast, where the period ranges from 10 to 30 seconds; and slow, with periods of several minutes. We focus here only on the slow oscillations in pancreatic β-cells.

## Materials

The islet and dispersed islet cells were isolated from pancreata of 8- to 10-wk-old C57BL/6J **mice**.

## Model Development

Parameters: [Table1](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.00595.2004#T1)

### Glucose consumption

![](https://journals.physiology.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/physio/journals/content/ajpendo/2005/ajpendo.2005.289.issue-5/ajpendo.00595.2004/production/images/eqs/eq-00001.gif)

Glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase (**GK**) is the only limiting step in glucose consumption in pancreatic β-cells under physiological conditions.

### Reduce equivalent

`KRe` is determined by the quantity of ATP molecules that is produced from one glucose molecule, which equals **31** according to present estimations.

### OXPHOS

![](https://journals.physiology.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/physio/journals/content/ajpendo/2005/ajpendo.2005.289.issue-5/ajpendo.00595.2004/production/images/eqs/eq-00003.gif)

The dependence of oxidative phosphorylation (JOP) on free MgADP may be calculated using the Hill equation.

We do not take into account effects of Ca2+ on the rate of ATP production in this model.

### ATP and ADP homeostasis

Over 90% of cellular ATP is in `MgATP` form. Thus are about the same concnetrations.

We added the balance equations for free ADP ([ADPf]i) and bound ADP ([ADPb]i). We assume that the concentration of free MgADP in pancreatic β-cells is 1/20 that of total cytosolic ADP.

### KATP channels

Free ATP inhibits, whereas MgADP activates, KATP channels.

Decreased free ADP concentration in its physiological range can decrease the open probability of KATP channels at constant ATP concentrations.

### Computational aspects

This model is available for direct simulation on the website “Virtual Cell” ( www.nrcam.uchc.edu) in “MathModel Database” on the “math workspace” in the library “Fridlyand” with name “Chicago.2”.

- slow Ca oscillations when `[Glc]` is above a threshold level of ∼7 mM
- slow oscillations correlate well with our previous model

## Discussion

Intracellular free ATP concentration increases only modestly with increased glucose concentration in pancreatic β-cells or islets.

An increase of glucose from 4 to 8 mmol/l led to a decrease of free MgADP from ∼44 to ∼31 μM.

In intact INS-1 insulinoma cells, citrate and ATP oscillations are in phase with each other.

Slow metabolic oscillations could be driven by cytoplasmic Ca2+ oscillations has previously been dismissed.

The primary role of mitochondrial Ca2+ is the stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Slow Ca2+ oscillations are the driving force of metabolic oscillations in pancreatic β-cells.
