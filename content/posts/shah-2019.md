## Introduction

Cells continuously adjust the rate of mitochondrial fission and fusion in response to changing energy and metabolic demands to facilitate the shapes and distribution of mitochondria throughout the cell. The mitochondrial network organization makes a bidirectional relationship with the cellâ€™s bioenergetics and metabolic variables.

Many neuronal, metabolic, and renal diseases have been linked to primary or secondary changes in mitochondrial dynamics.

**ROS** induces fragmentation of mitochondrial network, overproduction of ROS in hyperglycemic conditions requires dynamic changes in mitochondrial morphology and fragmentation of the network.

High cytosolic **Ca** induces mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas fragmentation blocks the propagation of toxic intracellular Ca2+ signals and can limit the local Ca2+ uptake capacity of mitochondria due to their smaller sizes.

In this paper, we adopt and extend the method developed in Refs. using a pipeline of computational tools that process and extract a range of network parameters from mitochondrial micrographs recorded through fluorescence microscopy, and simulate mitochondrial networks to determine microscopic rates of fission and fusion leading to the observed network properties.

## Methods

### Image analysis of mitochondrial network topologies

These topologies can be uniquely distinguished by various network parameters
- the mean degree `<k>` (the average number of nearest neighbors)
- giant cluster `Ng` (the largest cluster in the network)
- giant cluster normalized with respect to the total number of nodes (mitochondria) or edges (connections) `Ng/N`,
- and distributions of various features such as the number of mitochondria in various linear branches, cyclic loops, and clusters comprising both branches and loops.

In MATLAB
- Create binary image by `im2bw`.
- Skeletonize by `bwmorph`.
- Label different clusters by `bwlabel`.

All the above properties are extracted for mitochondrial networks in the cells with different pathologies and the corresponding control cells for comparison.

### Modeling and simulating mitochondrial network

The model described in Sukhorukov et al.

Larger values of C1 and C2 mean more frequent tip-to-tip and tip-to-side fusion respectively, and vice versa.

## Results

### Data aquisition

We processed images of mitochondrial networks in cells with various neurological pathologies including AD `[79]`, ALS `[80]`, PD `[81]`, HD `[78]`, OPA `[66]`, Ca2+ overload in astrocytes `[14]`, and DS `[36, 82]` as well as other conditions such as kidney disease `[64]` and diabetes/cancer `[65]` from published literature.

Key network parameters such as `<k>`, `Ng`, `Ng/N` retrieved from the diseased cells and their normal counterparts are listed in [`Table 1`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6762132/table/pone.0223014.t001/).

- All conditions resulted in fragmentation of the underlying mitochondrial network, compared to mitochondria in healthy cells.
- Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

### Stochastic simulation

Final results from these simulations are summarized in [`Table 2`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6762132/table/pone.0223014.t002/).

On average, simulating the network with one set of C1 and C2 values and 100 repetitions to minimize the stochastic variability, takes 5 to 10 hours (depending on N).

### There are two types of mitochondrial fission

Some have reduced C1 (tip-to-tip fusion), some have reduced C2 (tip-to-side fusion).

See [Table 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6762132/table/pone.0223014.t003/).

## Discussion

A tight balance between fission and fusion of mitochondria is crucial for the normal cell function `[20, 29, 123]`.

It is worth mentioning that the class (transient versus complete) of fusion depends on the way two mitochondria interact with each other.

The nine conditions can be divided into two main groups.
- tip-to-side: AD, HD, DS, Ca2+ overload, diabetes/cancer, and acute kidney injury pathologies
- tip-to-tip: OPA, PD, and ALS
