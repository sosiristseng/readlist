## Introduction

Close relationship between energy production and mt-network organization.

- Observations of Hackenbrock (Hackenbrock, 1966; Hackenbrock, 1968; Hackenbrock et al., 1971) revealed a rapid and reversible change of the mitochondrion from the so-called `orthodox' to `condensed' conformations upon activation of ATP synthesis

- The opposite is also true, because pathological mutations in genes responsible for mitochondrial fusion or fission have been associated with alterations in the organization of the mt-network and with the inhibition of energy metabolism

Study:  Analysis of the crosstalk between mitochondrial bioenergetics and organelle-network organization.

## Results

DRP1 (fission) is inhibited by DRP1-targeting  siRNA

- HeLa cells containing siRNA targeting DRP1 showed a slower rate of proliferation in glucose medium
- Mitochondrial energy production is impaired in HeLa cells lacking DRP1
  - Isolated mitochondria from HeLa cells lacking DRP1 presented with a slower rate of state-4 and state-3 respirations

## Discussion

- (b,c): OXPHOS uncoupling with CCCP
- (d-f): respiratory chain inhibition with rotenone
- (g,h): inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis with oligomycin

### Fragmentation by
- The presence of uncouplers such as CCCP, DNP or FCCP
- ρ0 cells
- oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the F1F0-ATP synthase
- Hydroxycinamic acid, an inhibitor of the phosphate carrier
- cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of the mPTP
- Inhibition of respiratory chain complex I and complex III

### Conclusion
The relationship between mitochondrial form and function are bidirectional
