## Introduction

Dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to the initiation and progression of diverse human cancers, affecting aspects such as cancer metastasis, drug resistance and cancer stem cell survival, suggesting that targeting mitochondrial dynamics is a potential therapeutic strategy.

Mitochondrial dynamics contributes to the genesis and progression of various kinds of human cancers. (Chen 2017)

This review focuses on summarizing fundamental cellular functions impacted by unbalanced fusion and fission.

## Proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission

GTPases, all of them are dynamin-related GTPases

- Fusion: mitofusin (Mfn) 1 and 2 on OMM and Opa1 on IMM
- Fission: Drp1 on OMM, @ ER tubules contact, mediated by outer membrane proteins, including Mff, Fis1, Mid49 and Mid51

The activity of Drp1 is regulated by **posttranslational modifications**. Several different posttranslational modifications of Drp1, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Fis1 binds to Mfn1, Mfn2 and Opa1, thus inhibiting their fusion GTPase activity.

## Lipids and mitochondrial fission

Cardiolipin (CL) has been shown to stimulate the oligomerization of Drp1, which induces its tubulation and sequential mitochondrial fission.

Diacylglycerol (DAG) triggers mitochondrial fission.

Ceramides stimulate mitochondrial fission in cardiomyocytes.

A reduction in the PE/PS ratio shifts mitochondrial dynamics toward fission and exerts an anticancer effect.

## Biological functions of mitochondrial dynamics

### ROS production

The mitochondrial electron transport chain is a major contributor to ROS production in cancer cells. Mitochondrial *fission* promoted ROS production.

Cancer cells managed to maintain moderate levels of ROS, which facilitate tumor initiation and progression. e.g. Ras/MAPK/ERK, PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways.

### Cell migration

The researchers found higher expression of Drp1 and lower expression of Mfn1 in metastatic breast cancer cells than in their nonmetastatic counterparts. (fission -> metastasis)

A side evidence is from lymphocytes. Dysregulation of mitochondrial fusion/fission suppresses lymphocyte polarization and migration.

### Mitophagy

Damaged (depolarized) mitochondria are degraded through a specialized form of macroautophagy called mitophagy. Via Parkin pathway and the Parkin-independent pathway.

Mitochondrial fission plays an important role, as mitophagy is preceded by mitochondrial division.

### Cell metabolism

Mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to the balance between energy demand and nutrient supply. Fusion is positively associated with increased ATP production.

(Prostate cancer cells) Drp1 upregulation is required for metabolic reprogramming because it controls the mitochondrial pyruvate transport complex.

(hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) Mfn1 regulates metastasis by shifting cell metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS.

### Apoptosis

An important step during apoptosis is *mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization* (MOMP) = cytochrome c release, mediated by BAX and BAK.

### cell cycle

G1 and G2 phases, interconnected network (fusion) vs. fragmented during S phase and mitosis (fission). mediated by the dynamics of  Drp1, Fis1, Opa1 and Mfn proteins.

Serine/threonine kinase Aurora A (AURKA) is overexpressed in several cancers => inducing fission at physiological levels but enhancing mitochondrial fusion when overexpressed.

## Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics in human cancers

Mitochondrial dynamics in the onset and progression of cancer has emerged ([Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7269774/table/tbl01/))

##  Conclusion

In most cases, mitochondrial fission facilitates the proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance of cancer cells, causing cancer development. However, in some cancers, mitochondrial fusion has been found to promote malignant phenotypes of cancer cells.

mitochondrial dynamics affects the proliferation of bulk cancer cells as well as the survival and stemness maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
