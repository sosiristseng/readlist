Altered expression and activity of key glycolytic enzymes in tumor cells rather than restricted mitochondrial function is the culprit.

Increased **ROS** levels primarily emanating from the mitochondria are a noted feature of transformed cells. Oncogene-induced ROS promotes tumorigenesis in numerous ways, including stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α.

## Mitochondria are highly dynamic

Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles responding to cellular stress through changes in overall mass, interconnectedness, and sub-cellular localization.
The extent to which control of mitochondrial dynamics, not only rates of fission versus fusion, but also changes in mitochondrial mass and sub-cellular spatial organization.

## Fission versus Fusion in Cancer

Re-modeling of the mitochondrial network in cells is mechanically regulated by key **dynamin-related** fission and fusion GTPase and takes place in response to hypoxia, cell cycle cues, changing energy demands, and other cellular stresses.

### fission and fusion

- fission: Dynamin-related GTPase, Drp1 @OMM ER contacts, plus Mitochondrial Fission Factor (Mff), Fis1, MiD49, MiD51.
- fusion: Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 @ OMM; Opa-1 @ IMM.

### Energy production and mitochondrial dynamics

Stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion” that relies upon canonical fusion proteins (Opa-1, Mfn1), promoting ATP production through more efficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Stress could be glucose deprivation.


Fusion
- Opa1: invloved in cristae formation -> more efficient ETCs.
- May increase carbon flux into mitochondria in the mitochondrial network
- mtDNA compensation? the effects of fusion on oxidative metabolism are post-translational and not primarily dependent on gene complementation between mitochondrial genomes.

Fission
- Hypoxia limits OXPHOS in a number of ways but promoting mitochondrial fission (Drp-1, Fis-1) may be one of the key mechanisms.

### cell cycle and mitochondrial dynamics

- Increased mitochondrial fusion is required not only for efficient oxidative metabolism (68, 69) but is necessary for proliferation and entry into S-phase.
- Glycolysis is also cell cycle regulated and increases at the G1/S-phase boundary.

## Dual role of Bcl-2 family members in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis

- Mitochondrial fusion can delay cytochrome c release and apoptosis.
- Mitochondrial fission promotes mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release and apoptosis.
- Apoptotic Bak and Bax promotes fusion.
- The anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL has been shown to promote mitochondrial fission.

## Altered Mitochondrial Mass in Cancer

Our data identifies significant variation in mitochondrial mass between tumors in different individuals.

### Biogenesis

- mitochondrial biogenesis is tumor promoting by increasing metabolite and energy generation.
- a different argument suggests that the production of new healthy mitochondria may be tumor suppressive by promoting oxidative metabolism
- It depends.

### Mitophagy

- **PINK1** (Pten-induced putative kinase-1) is a serine/threonine kinase that undergoes voltage-dependent proteolysis at the IMM in healthy mitochondria but accumulates at the OMM in response to depolarization
