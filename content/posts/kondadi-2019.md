## Mitochondrial Membrane Structure and Cristae Biogenesis

The cristae membrane (CM) not just as mere invaginations of the IM into the matrix; instead, the CM is a structurally and functionally distinct subcompartment of the IM.

Crista junctions (CJs) have diameter of 12–40 nm at the neck of cristae, separating the mitochondria into several subcompartments, the intermembrane space (IMS) between the IM and OM, the intracristal space (ICS) and the matrix.

### Optic Atrophy Type 1 (OPA1)

OPA1 plays a dual role in IMM fusion as well as cristae biogenesis.

Joint action of long and short OPA1 forms is proposed to be necessary to keep CJs closed, thereby limiting the diffusion/release of metabolites including cytochrome c.

### F1FO ATP Synthase

The stable association of two ATP synthase monomers at a defined angle leads to bending of the IM creating protrusions and a strong positive curvature at cristae tips.

### Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing System (MICOS) Complex

## Organization and Structure of mtDNA

Each mitochondrion released an average of two to six circular DNA molecules present as monomer or dimers either in extended or partially coiled configuration upon osmotic stress. In addition, 80% of mtDNA monomers remained bound to mitochondrial membranes.

## Interplay between Mitochondrial Dynamics and mtDNA

In mammals, mitochondria undergo fusion with the help of large GTPases, Mitofusins 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2) for the OM and OPA1 for the IM. Fusion is required for proper inheritance of mtDNA and content mixing.

Fission in mammals is coordinated by another large dynamin-like GTPase, namely, DRP1. DNM2, MFF (mitochondrial fission factor), MID49, MID51 (mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa) and FIS1 (mitochondrial fission 1 protein). Mitochondrial fission is essentail for mitochondrial transport and quality control (mitophagy).

ER contact with mitochondria and actin cytoskeleton also play crucial roles in mitochondria division.

mtDNA synthesis was shown to couple with mitochondrial fission at the ER–mitochondria contact sites.

## Conclusion

Summarizing a rather complex and interdependent interplay between mitochondrial dynamics, cristae biogenesis and mtDNA maintenance and integrity.

Loss of mitochondrial dynamics frequently leads to aberrant cristae formation and that aberrations in cristae morphology frequently result in loss of mtDNA.
