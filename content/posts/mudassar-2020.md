The development of tumor hypoxia and the associated metabolic pathways is one of the most important contributors to clinical radioresistance. Under hypoxic conditions, DNA free radicals can restore back to their original form due to low oxygen levels, and irreversible DNA damage does not occur, thus compromising the radiation-induced DNA damage in the hypoxic tumor cells. Hypoxic radioresistance in gliomas which generally arises when oxygen levels in tumors drop to ~ 0–10 mmHg.

## Role of Hypoxia and Mitochondrial Metabolism in Cancer Progression

HIFs DriveS Aerobic Glycolysis.

Hypoxia and HIF-1α increase glucose channeling into glycolysis while suppressing OXPHOS and mitochondrial respiration by decreasing the input into mitochondria.

Lactate stimulates angiogenesis and supresses immune cells.

## Mitochondrial Biogenesis and Oxidative Phosphorylation in Cancers

Cancer cells display high metabolic plasticity and can alter their metabolic phenotypes under various selection pressures. Thus, some cancers also rely on mitochondrial biogenesis and OXPHOS for energy production and in vivo progression.

## Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) and Mitochondrial Metabolism

CSCs undergo dynamic and reversible changes and exhibit a robust behavior due to functions including rapid DNA repair, resistance to oxidative stress, and adaptation to a hypo-nutrient microenvironment. They are highly dependent on mitochondrial biogenesis for survival and propagation. In glioma cells, CSCs are less glycolytic and predominantly reliant on mitochondrial function and OXPHOS, producing large amounts of ATP.

Both normal brain tissue and gliomas share metabolic symbiosis through lactate transporters (MCTs).

## Targeting Tumor Hypoxia by inhibiting Mitochondrial Metabolism

Targeting hypoxia is an attractive approach to overcome radioresistance and enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy. In contrast to the previous strategies, current research focuses on reducing oxygen demand by decreasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an alternative approach to abolish tumor hypoxia.
