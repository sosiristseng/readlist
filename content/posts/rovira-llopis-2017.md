In this review, we discuss the molecular pathways of mitochondrial dynamics, their impairment under type 2 diabetes.


## Introduction

Mitochondrial impairment can contribute to the development of age-dependent insulin resistance.

Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes are directly related to oxidative stress. In type 2 diabetic patients, high levels of glucose can induce glucose oxidation, and excessive ROS are produced from mitochondrial complex I and III. Antioxidant systems are triggered as a response. e.g. SOD, UCP-1.

## Mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics

Fusion and fission processes are essential for the maintenance of important cellular functions such as mitochondrial respiratory activity, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) distribution, apoptosis, cell survival or calcium signalling.

Whereas this pro-fusion state is typical in situations of increased energy efficiency due to starvation or acute stress, the opposite occurs when cells are subjected to a large nutrient supply such as in obesity or type 2 diabetes, related to uncoupled respiration.

## Type 2 diabetes and mitochondrial dynamics

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5284490/bin/gr3.jpg "Interaction between mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in type 2 diabetes")

GSIS: an enhanced level of glucose induces oxidative phosphorylation in β- cells, increasing the ATP/ADP ratio and inhibiting K+ channels that can depolarize the plasma membrane and lead to enhanced Ca2+ levels inside the cells.

Insulin resistance (in muscle cells) is a common characteristic of type 2 diabetes and mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with it. Obese patients presented a global expressional downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative pathways.

Type 2 diabetes is related to a reduced expression of MFN2, which may be linked to an impairment of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle.

Mitochondria from type 2 diabetic patients are smaller than in healthy controls [40], and hyperglycemia induce mitochondrial fragmentation in different cell types, including heart, liver, cardiovascular or pancreas.
