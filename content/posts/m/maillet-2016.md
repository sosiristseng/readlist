## Introduction
* Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC): acute atrial and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as chronic cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cumulative dose-dependent
* topoisomerase-II beta **Top2β**) in the pathogenesis of DIC
* human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) as the testing platform

## Results
### Generation and characterization of hPSC-derived CMs
* upregulation of cardiac markers cTnT, NKX2-5 and MYH7, predominantly ventricular-like
### Doxorubicin triggers cell death with apoptotic and necrotic features in hPSC-derived CMs
* measurement of ATP levels => cell viability
* IC50 of 30.1 μM. Starting @ 5μM
* Annexin V (early apoptosis) & propidium iodide (late apoptosis/necrosis) staining
### Doxorubicin leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production in hPSC-derived CMs
* AA = antimycin A (positive control).  MitoSOX Red dye
* significant decrease in ΔΨm after 1 h of treatment with 5 μM of doxorubicin
### Doxorubicin induces an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the formation of double-strand DNA breaks
* [Ca2+]i level before treatment was relatively low and increased 2.5 fold after treatment with 5 μM of doxorubicin for 16 h
* doxorubicin treatment induced the DNA damage signal γ-H2AX in hPSC-derived CMs in a dose-dependent manner
### Multi-electrode array electrophysiology and response to doxorubicin
* dose- and time-dependent decrease in beat period and spike amplitude @ as low as 0.25 μM of doxorubicin
* doxorubicin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the corrected field potential duration (cFPD) ~= QTc interval: earlier repolarization caused by doxorubicin
### Effects of doxorubicin on gene expression
* KEGG pathway analysis & GO analysis
* structural gene-based cardiomyopathy (**remodeling**) pathways as being commonly upregulated among the three conditions (Fig. 6d). Conversely, the Wnt signaling pathway was found to be down-regulated in all conditions
### TOP2B is essential for doxorubicin-induced cell death in hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
* TOP2B KO by CRISPR-Cas9: more resistant to doxorubicin-induced double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and cell deaths
## Discussion
* DOX treatment: significant production of ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and increased [Ca2+]i in hPSC-derived CMs
* DOX-induced arrhythmias
* transcriptome profiling: doxorubicin induces a broad program of gene expression associated with cellular remodeling and impaired cardiomyocyte function
* CMs express **TOP2B** but not TOP2A, and recently, Top2B was shown to be critical for DIC in a mouse model. Using **CRISPR-Cas9**, we showed that disruption of TOP2B reduces the sensitivity of hPSC-CMs to doxorubicin-induced DSBs
* limitations
    1. hPSC-derived CMs are less mature than native adult myocytes
    2. mixture of cells atrial-, ventricular- and nodal-like phenotypes
    3. single-cell models and lack 3D tissue interactions
