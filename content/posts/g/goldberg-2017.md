Whole-cell (WC) computational models aim to predict cellular phenotypes from genotype and the environment by representing the function of each gene, gene product, and metabolite.

<!--more-->

We propose that WC models aim to represent all of the chemical reactions in a cell and all of the physical processes that influence their rates

- the **sequence** of each chromosome, RNA, and protein
- the **structure** of each molecule
- the **subcellular organization** of cells into organelles and microdomains
- the participants and effect of each **molecular interaction**
- the **kinetic parameters** of each interaction
- the **concentration** of each species in each organelle and microdomain
- the concentration of each species in the **extracellular environment**

The things WC models aim to proedict:

- **stochastic dynamics** of each molecular interaction
- **temporal dynamics** of the concentration of each species
- **spatial dynamics** of the concentration of each species in each organelle and microdomain
- complex **phenotypes** such as cell shape, growth rate, motility, and fate, as well as the **variation** in the behavior of single cells within clonal populations

enables WC models to generate predictions that could be embedded into higher-order multiscale models.

## AVAILABLE RESOURCES

WC models require a ton of parameters.

### Measurement methods

single-cell and genomic measurement

- Meth-Seq ([genomewide DNA methylation analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20125086/).)
- Hi-C ([chromosome structures](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657480/))
- ChIP-seq ([protein-DNA interactions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19736561/))
- fluorescence microscopy: protein localizations
- mass-spectrometry: metabolite and protein concentrations
- FISH and scRNA-seq: dynamics and single-cell variation of RNA abundances

### Data repositories

[A list of public repositories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997489/bin/NIHMS928198-supplement.xlsx) (in Excel file).

### Prediction tools

However, many current prediction tools lack sufficient accuracy for WC modeling.

### Emerging methods and tools, Data aggregation and organization

- (a) Data should be aggregated from thousands of publications, repositories, and prediction tools and organized into a PGDB. (e.g.  [Pathway Tools](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26454094/), [Whole Cell KB](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23175606/))
- (b) Models should be designed, calibrated, and validated from PGDBs and described using rules.
- (c) Models should be simulated using parallel, network-free, multi-algorithmic simulators and their results should be stored in a database.
- (d) Simulation results should be visualized and analyzed.
- (e) Results should be validated by comparison to experimental measurements. Importantly, all of these steps should be collaborative.

## TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES

- Experimental measurement: Measuring kinetic parameters at the interactome scale.
- Prediction tools: Accurately predict the molecular effects of insertions, deletions, and structural variants.

- Scalable, data-driven model design
- Rule-based model representation: No existing language supports all of the biological processes that WC models must represent.
- Scalable multi-algorithmic simulation
- Calibration and verification
- Simulation analysis
- Collaboration
