## Background

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) model:

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-1.jpg "Schematic diagram")

Pyruvate is the main end product of glycolysis in β-cells and essential for mitochondrial ATP synthesis.

An important β-cell specialization is the very low expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Re-oxidizing cytoplasmic NADH by two mitochondrial hydrogen shuttles: the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle.

The respiratory rate is lower and relative leak activity is higher in isolated β-cell mitochondria.

Glycolytic flux is mainly controlled by glucokinase reaction.

- [Nan Jiang](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/instance/1998884/bin/335_2007_9011_Fig1_HTML.jpg): too complex (44 reactions).


This model has qualitative properties consistent with expectations for the pancreatic β-cell including showing appropriate oscillations in mitochondrial metabolism and Ca2+ concentration.

## Results and Discussion

### Steady state stimulation with a step increase in glucose concentration

[Table1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/table/T1/): timulated steady-state values for low glucose (5 mM)

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-2.jpg "Effect of increasing glucose on cell energetics")

The rise in ATP/ADP ratio as well as in relative NAD(P)H, Ψm, [Ca2+]m and oxygen consumption were also observed with glucose stimulation in control INS-1 cells.

Relative rate of phosphorylation (□) was based on experimental data [131] for human cell line mitochondria

### Decreased Ψm and respiratory activity regulate mitochondrial glucose sensitivity in β-cells

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-3.jpg "Comparison with muscle cell mitochondria")
- increased step by step the maximal rate of respiration (Vme, Equation 5) from basal β-cell level (arrow)

### Changes in leak activity and the role of uncoupling agents

Decreased leak activity increased Ψm and reduced the sensitivity range of the inner membrane potential to glucose leading to a left-shift in the ATP/ADP ratio and $\ce{[Ca^2+]}_c$ response.

The shifting set-point mechanism would regulate insulin secretion particularly during a fluctuating nutrient supply.Either an under or over-expression of UCP2 may lead to a failure of β-cells to properly respond to glucose.

### Role of Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lactate production

The simulated lactate production increased significantly in response to high glucose. This can be accounted for by increased $\ce{[NADH]}_c$/$\ce{[NAD+]}_c$.

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-5.jpg "Model parameters in response to changes of lactate dehydrogenase activity")

Low levels of LDH expression in insulin-secreting cells are important for the correct channeling of pyruvate towards mitochondrial metabolism

### Role of NADH in cytoplasm and shuttle activity

Changes in cytoplasmic redox level could be manifested primarily through variation in $\ce{[NADH]}_c$. NADH generated by glycolysis was efficiently reoxidized by highly active mitochondrial shuttles rather than by lactate dehydrogenase in basal conditions in our model

NADH shuttle are important for coupling glycolysis and OXPHOS.

### Role of calcium

Mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration as an accelerator of ATP production.

Mitochondrial Ca2+ influx as a suppressor of ATP production is not supported in beta-cell data. The contribution of Ca2+ cycling to proton leak was estimated to be only about 1% of the state 3 rate.

Regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration by [Ca2+]m:
- Cardiomyocytes: 58.5% cytosolic and 36% mitochondrial volumes. Mitochodria are large buffer of Ca.
- β-cell mitochondrial volumes ranged from only 4% to 8% per cell. Mitochodrial buffering is limited.


**ER** volume can be up to 20% of total β-cell volume.

### Suppression of respiratory activity

Increased [NADH]m with decreased Vme, however, Ψm, ATP production, respiration rate, ATP/ADP ratio and [Ca2+]c were also decreased.

### Suppression of F1F0 ATPase activity


![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-9.jpg "Model parameters in response to changes of the maximal rate of proton flux in F1F0 ATPase")

## Oscillation processes

Oscillations in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metabolism, membrane potential, intracellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ due to increased glucose concentrations has been described as a specific characteristic of glucose signaling in the β-cell.

For ease of use here we employed a simplified mathematical model that created a periodically varied [Ca2+]c in the cytoplasm.

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896931/bin/1742-4682-7-15-11.jpg "Model-predicted dynamic responses of parameters in pancreatic β-cells for independent [Ca2+]c oscillations at 9 mM glucose concentration")

The metabolic and membrane variables in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix can display oscillatory behavior when [Ca2+]c oscillated independently.

Each [Ca2+]c increase during oscillations:
- increased cytoplasmic ATP consumption and thus increased ADP
- amplification of ATP synthesis by the mitochondrial F1F0 ATPase
- decrease in Ψm
- increases ETC activity
- enhanced [NADH]m consumption and the respiration rate (O2 consumption).

## Regulation of ROS content in β-cells

β-cells have relatively low levels of free radical detoxifying and redox-regulating enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and thioredoxin.

- ROS may also subserve a signaling function.
- β-cells usually work at a relatively lower Ψm (< 160 mV) compared with other types of cells. Low ROS production.
- increased sensitivity of β-cell mitochondria to damage.
