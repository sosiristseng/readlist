## SMALL GTPases Control Mitochondrial Fusion and Fission

- Fusion: Mfn1, Mfn2, Opa1
- Fission: Drp1
  - Activated by Fis1, Mff, MiD49, MiD51, MAPK1(mitosis),  calcineurin (proton leak)
  - Inhibited by PKA (starvation)

## Imbalanced Mitochondrial Metabolism Results in Obesity and Diabetes

The role of GTPases in obesity and diabetes is in [Table1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6734166/table/T1/).

### Mfn2

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is related to the reduced expression of Mfn2.

### Opa1

- **Opa1** deletion in pancreatic β cells impairs glucose-stimulated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and insulin secretion
- Insulin increases **Opa1** levels and promotes mitochondrial fusion in cardiomyocytes, which enhances OXPHOS, whereas Opa1 deletion suppresses the insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis.

### Drp1

**Drp1**-mediated mitochondrial fission results in mitochondrial fragmentation along with decreased ATP content, which further leads to reduced insulin-mediated glucose uptake in human skeletal muscle and significant loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mouse pancreatic β cells.

**Drp1** deletion largely impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) without affecting oxygen consumption and intracellular calcium mobilization.

## Mitochondrial Fusion and Fission Shape Cancer Metabolism

In general, oxidative metabolism is less active in the fragmented mitochondria when compared to the tubular mitochondria.

The highly activated glycolysis has been linked to mitochondrial fission in many types of cancer.

Nevertheless, active oxidative metabolism has also been connected to mitochondrial fusion in some metastatic cancer models, including pancreatic cancer

**Mfn1/2** shows lowered expression in human tumors.  Mfn2 overexpression inhibits cancer cell proliferation and colony formation and weakens the invasion and migratory ability.

## Summary

Dysregulated metabolism is a common feature of the metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer, which can be regulated by mitochondrial dynamics.
