## Molecular mechanism

### Mitochondrial dependent ROS
* cationic drug doxorubicin is retained in the **mitochondrial inner membrane** (IMM) by forming a nearly-irreversible complex with **cardiolipin**
    * Inhibiting ETC complexes
* doxorubicin treatment affects mitochondrial gene expression & suppresses cardiac mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis
* Upregulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD): increase survival
### NOS (NO synthase) dependent ROS
* Binding of doxorubicin to endothelial NOS (eNOS) reductase domain (eNOS uncoupling) results in superoxide generation, related to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis
* Inducible NOS (iNOS): controversial
### NAD(P)H-dependent ROS
* doxorubicin and NAD(P)H can produce a little superoxide in the absence of any enzymatic activity
* NAD(P)H oxidase as another source
### Fe – DOX complex
* DOX decreases iron sequenster expression => more free iron => (DOX binds to iron) => toxicity
* redox cycling => lipid peroxidation, protein (thiol group) oxidation
### Apoptosis

* By oxidative stress
### Intracellular calcium dysregulation
* Both a result and a cause of ROS-generation.
### Changes in the high-energy phosphate pool
* Depletion of ATP/ PCr, depolarizations of mitochondria due to oxidative stress
* Creatine kinase (CK) is inhibited by ROS
### Endothelin-1 (ET-1)
* *survival signaling* in CMCs counteracted by the *vasoconstrictive* effects of endothelin-1 on the vasculature
### Extracellular matrix remodeling
* Inhibits MMP-1 (less tumor cell metastasis), enhances MMP-2, MMP-9 in the heart => tissue remodeling
## Symptoms and diagnostic tools
* acute, subacute and late toxicity
* Acute: usually resolve spontaneously within several hours or weeks after the completion of chemotherapy in most patients
* subacute: rare
* Chronic: dose-dependent, monitored by trponin, LVEF...
## Therapeutic and preventive possibilities

* most effective: modulating the **dosage**.
* Dexrazoxane: competes Top 2β binding => prevents depletion of mitochondrial DNA
* β-blocker / ACEi/ ARB: when HF is indicated
* EPO?
* Preventive administration of *sildenafil*, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor
    * mitochondrial KATP channel opening
    * NOS-dependent
    * sildenafil and doxorubicin produce greater amounts of ROS in cancer cells. On the other hand, this combination produced less ROS in normal cells
* cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): implant, for non-responser to cardioprotective medication
* heart transplantation
