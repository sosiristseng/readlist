## Introduction
* Computational modelling was developed to complement experimental approaches to improve understanding of cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis
* a central role for **Ca2+ handling** abnormalities has been identified in promoting ectopic activity and re‐entry, the two major mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF)

## Differences between atrial, ventricular and sinoatrial node cardiomyocytes

* Atrial cardiomyocytes possessing a number of ion currents that are largely absent in the ventricle (e.g. ultra‐rapid delayed‐rectifier K+ current IKur, or acetylcholine‐activated inward‐rectifying K+ current IK,ACh)
* SAN cardiomyocytes additionally express more hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels but have relatively few Na+ channels. T‐type Ca2+ current is largest in the SAN.
* ventricular cardiomyocytes have a larger basal inward‐rectifying K+ current (IK1)
* differences in Ca2+ handling between cell types
    * ventricular myocytes having a well‐developed system of membrane invaginations (t‐tubules) => homogeneous activation
    * atrial myocytes: centripetal Ca2+ wave
## Role of Ca2+ handling abnormalities in atrial arrhythmias
* Ca2+ overload can activate NCX => EADs and DADs, cardiac alternans
* Ca signalling pathways => remodeling

### Types of ion‐channel models
* instantaneous, time‐independent (rapid equilibrium): IK1
* Hodgkin–Huxley gating variables
* Markov models: states variables, more complex, additionally capture dependent state transitions

## Spatial models of atrial Ca2+ handling
* transverse segmentation allows simulation of the centripetal Ca2+ wave
* subsarcolemmal SR Ca2+‐release sites influence AP shape, whereas the central release sites control centripetal Ca2+ wave propagation
* However, common‐pool models also show alternans, as recently demonstrated for the Grandi model (Chang et al. 2014). This type of alternans critically depends on intrinsic RyR2 properties.
* both transverse and longitudinal compartmentation of Ca2+ handling (Fig. 4 C), along with stochastic gating of RyR2s using a Markov‐model approach => The combination of changes produces sustained triggered activity = paroxysmal AF (pAF)

## Applications of computational modelling in AF research

* It's not experimentally possible to modulate the function of a single channel or transporter in human atrial cardiomyocytes with high specificity. Computational assessment of potential mechanisms of atrial arrhythmogenesis could help to identify experimental findings about changes in ion‐channel function
* The advances and applications of atrial cardiomyocyte models have been paralleled by advances in the development of models for other cell types (ventricular: common‐pool and spatial ‘local‐control’ models)
## Gaps in knowledge and future directions
* pronounced inter‐patient and regional variation: tissues surrounding the (PVs) have specific electrophysiological and Ca2+ handling properties, making them more likely to produce ectopic activity
* multiscale understanding of AF
* Channel modeling (e.g. RyR2)
