## Introduction

These mitochondria do not operate as isolated organelles; rather, they function as a collective whose activity is orchestrated by mitochondrial dynamics.

## Mitochondrial fusion and fission

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539982/bin/nihms885679f1.jpg "Regulation of mitochondrial fission and its role in cancer and stem cells")

Large GTPases of the dynamin family that are embedded on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Mammals have two mitofusins termed **MFN1** (Mitofusin 1) and **MFN2** (Mitofusin 2) in the OMM, and **OPA1** (Optic Atrophy 1) on the IMM. Disruption of mitochondrial fusion genes lead to neurodegenerative disease. (Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A)

The central player in mitochondrial fission is **DRP1** (Dynamin-related protein 1), a large GTPase. DRP1 constricts mitochondrial tubules, this compression is not sufficient to complete fission, and that DYN2 instead may be additionally required at the final step of scission.

## Mitochondrial dynamics during the cell cycle

Tubulation of the mitochondria network at the G1/S transition and extensive fragmentation during mitosis.

## Enhanced mitochondrial fission in cancer cells

DRP1 seems to be activated and the mitochondria were found to be highly fragmented in several cancer types.

brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) have a distinct mitochondrial profile, compared to non-initiating tumor cells.

## Cancer cell migration

Cancer cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acquire greater mobility and invasiveness.


Mitochondrial *fragmentation* has been found to increase in malignant cells and to promote tumor cell invasion.

NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) seems to regulate DRP1 involvement in cell migration in multiple cancer types. (glioma, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer)


## Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer

ROS promote tumor growth by altering cellular metabolism and acting as signaling molecules in growth factor pathways.

ROS can also affect expression and post-translational modifications of mitochondrial dynamic proteins, which may further stimulate tumorigenesis.

## Parallels between the mitochondrial and metabolic profiles of cancer cells and stem cells

In the presence of ample nutrients, high glycolytic flux generates sufficient cellular energy while providing the building blocks for cell growth.

Cancer cells are notoriously heterogeneous, and that the Warburg effect is not a feature of all types of cancers, or even of all cancer cells in a given tumor.

Stem cells rely primarily on “aerobic glycolysis” to generate energy. This is defined as preferential utilization of glycolysis over OXPHOS even in an environment rich with oxygen.

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5539982/bin/nihms885679f4.jpg "Mitochondrial and metabolic profiles of stem cells versus differentiated cells")

By favoring glycolysis over OXPHOS
- Less ROS to damage the genome.
- More anitoxidant from NADPH in PPP.
- More carbon source for cell division. e.g. PPP.
- cytosolic acetyl-CoA, derived from glycolytically produced pyruvate, is critical to maintain histone acetylation and thus, pluripotency.

Reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs is associated with downregulation of respiratory chain activity and increased glycolysis. Mitochondrial changes occur prior to the acquisition of pluripotential markers.

## Mitochondrial dynamics in stem cells

Mitochondrial fission driven by **DRP1** seems to play a crucial role in developing and maintaining pluripotency.

Mitochondrial fusion seems to work in opposition to fission by driving differentiation and decreasing cellular proliferation.

## Perspectives

Recent studies provide persuasive evidence that mitochondrial dynamics plays an important role in regulating the unique metabolism of cancer cells and their ability to rapidly proliferate.
