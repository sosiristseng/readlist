## Introduction

Within mitochondria, respiratory chain complexes I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and III (cytochrome bc1 complex; ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) are considered as the main producers of superoxide and derived reactive oxygen species.

The protonmotive Q-cycle first proposed by Peter Mitchell is generally accepted as the fundamental mechanism of proton pumping.

## The protonmotive Q-cycle and ROS generation

The net translocation of 2H+/2 e− is achieved by a directed uptake and release of protons at topologically separated ubiquinol-oxidation and ubiquinone-reduction sites, located at opposite sides of the membrane, and the vectorial transport of electrons through cytochrome b towards the negative side of the membrane.

Ubiquinol oxidation at the Qo site is the first and most critical step in the protonmotive Q-cycle.

The superoxide production at complex III at Qo site is enhanced upon addition of the Qi site inhibitor antimycin A. The ‘distal’ and 'tight' Qo site inhibitor stigmatellin completely abolishes the superoxide production while binding of a ‘proximal’ Qo site inhibitor like myxothiazol caused only a partial reduction.

ROS production strongly depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential. The membrane potential alone and not the protonmotive force determines the rate of superoxide production. The membrane potential severely slows down electron transfer from heme bL to heme bH thereby promoting a more reduced state of heme bL which then increases superoxide generation.

The redox state of the Q pool is another factor. There is a bell-shaped curve for antimycin A-dependent superoxide generation. The results indicated semireverse mode is the dominant way to produce ROS in complex III.

Complex III releases half of the superoxide into the intermembrane space (and the cytoplasm), another half into the matrix, while complex I releases superoxide exclusively into the matrix.

Oxidized cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase form an efficient scavenging system for superoxide. Besides, some SOD1 is present in the intermembrane space.
