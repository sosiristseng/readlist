[^Baradaran2013]: Baradaran R, Berrisford JM, Minhas GS, Sazanov LA. Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I. Nature. 2013 Feb 28;494(7438):443–8. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3672946/

<!--more-->

The first crystal structure of the entire, intact complex I (from *T. thermophilus*) at 3.3 Å resolution.

Complex I catalyses the transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, coupled to the translocation of four protons across the bacterial or inner mitochondrial membrane. This proton-pumping action creates pmf for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase.

$$
\text{NADH} + \text{H}^{+} + \text{Q}  + 4 \text{H}_{in}^{+} 
$$

Complex I consists of
- hydrophilic domain: all the redox centers for electron transfer non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and nine iron-sulphur (Fe-S) clusters.
- membrane domain: for proton translocation coupled with the hydrophilic domain. For each NADH is oxidized and 2 electrons are transferred to a ubiquinone, 4 proton are pumped outwards by conformational changes in this domain.
- accessory subunits: protecctive shell and may have a specialized functional role
