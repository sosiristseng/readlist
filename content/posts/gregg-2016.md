## Introduction

Aging is accompanied by impaired glucose homeostasis and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, culminating in the failure of insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

## Methods

Beta-cells were harvested from human and mouse.

NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to image islet metabolism.

β-Cell membrane potential and KATP conductance were measured.

Time-lapse Imaging of NAD(P)H, ATP/ADP, and Ca2+.

## Results and discussion

KATP channel and calcium oscillations:

## Conclusion

- Aged human and mouse β-cells exhibit similar defects in mitochondrial glucose sensing
- But mouse ones showed adaptation by decreasing the conductance of KATP channels.
