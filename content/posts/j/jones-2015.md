## Introduction to Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
* increased Ca2+ load
* impairment of cytosolic ATPases
* an increase in active Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)
* mitochondria are placed under strain leading to energetic impairment and an  increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
* Decreased PCr / ATP
* Decrease in levels of NADPH (antioxidant capacity)

## Methods
* EP: O’Hara-Rudy (ORd) ventricular cell model
* Contraction: metabolite sensitive formulation by Tran et al.:
* mitochondrial energetics with ROS: Gauthier et al.
* ATP and Cr shuttle: ECME model by Cortassa

![fig2 Tran et al. model was modified to simulate the experimentally observed increase in calcium sensitivity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/86698953-584c6e80-c042-11ea-90b6-931e22b6e257.png)

## Results
![fig3 The model accurately reproduced experimentally observed changes in action potential duration at 90% of repolarization (APD90) and the Calcium transient (CaT)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/86698955-58e50500-c042-11ea-80aa-562f41e24ba8.png)

* 14% reduction of the PCr/ATP ratio
* 26% decrease in mitochondrial NADPH

## Discussions
The effects increased Ca2+ sensitivity and electrical remodeling have on the contractile properties of the cell, energetics, and levels of ROS production
