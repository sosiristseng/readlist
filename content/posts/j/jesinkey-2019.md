## Summary

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6713209/bin/nihms-1535614-f0001.jpg "Graphical Abstract")

One key mechanism of β cell nutrient sensing uses the mitochondrial GTP (mtGTP) cycle.

mtGTP synthesized by succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) is hydrolyzed via mitochondrial PEPCK (PEPCK-M) to make phosphoenolpyruvate, a high-energy metabolite that integrates TCA cycling and anaplerosis with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).

### Glucose Sensing Is SCS Isoform Dependent

hSCS-GTP is crucial to GSIS but hSCS-ATP is not.

### mtGTP Enhances Insulin Biosynthesis and Content

### hSCS-GTP Cells Maintain Metabolic Fitness Despite Increased Secretory Burden

hSCS-GTP cells had a 20% higher proliferation rate than hSCS-ATP cells, despite higher secretory demands.

### mtGTP Shapes Mitochondria

mtGTP may adaptively modulate mitochondrial dynamics.

Confocal images of cells transiently expressing hSCS-GTP had longer, more fused mitochondria.

At high and low glucose concentrations, hSCS-GTP cells exhibited a 50% decrease in the mRNA of outer mitochondrial membrane fusion protein mitofusin-2 (**Mfn-2**).

mRNA transcript levels of mitochondrial fission protein **DRP-1** were increased by 28% in hSCS-GTP cells relative to hSCS-ATP cells exposed to hyperglycemia.

### mtGTP Regulates Cataplerosis

![](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6713209/bin/nihms-1535614-f0008.jpg "Impact of mtGTP Levels on Metabolic Fluxes")

PEPCK-M hydrolyzes mtGTP to convert OAA into PEP that cataplerotically exits the TCA.  hSCS-GTP cells had a higher fractional PEPCK-M flux (VPCK).

## DISCUSSION

Given that PC flux is associated with insulin secretion, that PEPCK-M flux accounts for the majority of PC flux, and that PEPCK-M cycling rates are at least as high as 30%–40% of the glycolytic rate,  mtGTP in coordination with PEP is well poised to signal energy levels in β cells.
