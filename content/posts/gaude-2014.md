In this review, we describe the link between mutations to mitochondrial enzymes and tumor formation.

## TCA cycle emzymes

Succinate dehydrogenase: SDH can behave as a classic tumor suppressor gene since the mutated allele is inherited in a heterozygous fashion, while the remaining wild type allele is lost in tumor samples

Fumarate hydratase: Fumarate shares some similarities with succinate and 2HG in that it can inhibit several OG-dependent enzymes, including PHDs, and histone and DNA demethylases.

Malic enzyme: producing NADPH for DNA synthesis


## OXPHOS enzymes

Intact **CI** activity is essential for cancer cell survival at low glucose levels, a condition commonly found in tumor microenvironment

**CIII**: mtDNA mutations that affect *CIII* activity are sufficient to drive tumorigenesis via a mechanism that involves ROS production and the inhibition of apoptosis.

**CIV**: mtDNA-encoded subunits are generally tumor-suppressing, whereas nDNA encoded-subunits are tumor-promoting.

**CV** can shape its activity to maintain mitochondrial potential and, eventually, to support survival.
