Compared to control islets, diabetic islets showed *reduced insulin secretion in response to glucose*, and this defect was associated with *lower ATP levels*, a *lower ATP/ADP ratio* and *impaired hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane*. Morphology studies showed that control and diabetic beta cells had a similar number of mitochondria; however, mitochondrial density volume was significantly higher in type 2 diabetic beta cells.
