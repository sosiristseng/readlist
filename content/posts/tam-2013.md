## Introduction

Mitochondrial DNA mutations can lead to the loss of mitochondrial function when the level of mutations exceeds a critical threshold. The proportion of cells with heteroplasmic mtDNA has been reported to significantly increase with age. Understanding how mtDNA mutations propagate and clonally expand in cells is critical in elucidating the pathogenesis of mitochondrial diseases as well as the ageing process.

Mixing of mtDNA is a result of mitochondrial fusion-fission, a process in which mitochondria fuse forming a larger organelle and a mitochondrion divides to form two separate organelles, respectively. Perturbations of mitochondrial fusion and fission have been shown experimentally to affect mitochondrial morphology and functions.

- Unless indicated otherwise, every mitochondrion has equal probability to be removed by mitophagy. An intermediate half-life of 30 days was used in this study.
- The sigmoidal function is motivated by the activity data of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) as a function of the relative proportion of wild-type and mutant mtDNA in cybrid cells.
- Based on the equation above, the maximum amplification of mtDNA replication by retrograde signaling (at RW = 0) is rmax +1, which has been reported to be ∼16 times the basal rate.

### Fission-Fusion events
- In a fusion event, two mitochondria were randomly selected from the set of feasible pairs.
- During the duplication process, a fission site was also created to preserve the original nucleoid distributions from each precursor mitochondrion.
- Fissions were assumed to occur along the length of the mitochondria with equal probability.
- The size of one of the daughter mitochondria was determined by taking a random integer from a discrete uniform distribution
- The reported distributions of mitochondrial sizes in the literature differ, from geometric [30] to unimodal [21] and multimodal distribution [20], but agree that larger mitochondria are less frequent than smaller ones.

## Results and Discussion

- Faster fusion-fission results in a better mixing of nucleoids in cells. When the number of mitochondria in the cell increases, the total propensity for fusion and fission events will rise and this correspondingly leads to a faster mixing of nucleoids. The model simulations were done using a steady state nucleoid population of 320 (or 80 mitochondria).
- Slower mtDNA mixing coincided with higher mutation burden variability among cells
- Imperfect mixing of mtDNA nucleoids can give rise to additional variability in the outcome of mitophagy events

Model simulations showed that the total mutation burden in the cell population increased with time.

In the model simulations, lowering either fusion or fission individually by 500 times from those for τ = 1 day, led to slower fusion-fission process and mixing of nucleoids.

Mitochondria with a lower membrane potential have been shown to be prevented from fusion with others and preferentially autophagosized (selective degradation), acting as a mechanism to selectively remove deleterious mtDNA mutations.


We have ignored the occurrence of de novo mutations.

The model also did not account for possible interactions between mtDNA turnover and mitochondrial fusion-fission,that are independent of mtDNA mutation burden and retrograde signalling.
