Adenylate kinase (AdK) which catalyzes the nucleotide phosphoryl exchange reaction 2ADP ↔ ATP + AMP.

- AK1(myofibril) and AK2 (IMS) specifically bind AMP and favor binding to ATP over other nucleotide triphosphates.
- AK3 (mt matrix) is a GTP:AMP phosphotransferase specific for the phosphorylation of intramitochondrial AMP.
- AK4 is enzymatically inactive it retains nucleotide binding capability, interacts with the mitochondrial ADP/ATP translocator and serves stress responsive protein function.

Adenylate kinase-facilitated high energy phosphoryl transfer and coordination between cellular sites of ATP consumption and ATP generation are essential for the safeguard of the cellular nucleotide pool and energy economy.
