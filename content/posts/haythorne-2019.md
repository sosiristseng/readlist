## Abstract

Hyperglycaemia induces metabolic changes in β-cells that markedly reduce mitochondrial metabolism and ATP synthesis. We propose this underlies the progressive failure of β-cells in diabetes.

## Introduction

We have explored this idea in detail using a comprehensive multi-omics approach coupled with functional analysis of mitochondrial metabolism.

We used the βV59M mouse model in which tamoxifen-inducible expression of a constitutively open ATP-sensitive potassium (**KATP**) channel specifically in pancreatic β-cells renders the β-cell electrically silent and inhibits insulin secretion. The mutant mice thus were in hyperglycemia.

## Results

### Metabolic gene and protein expression

**Reduced exression**
- OXPHOS
- branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism
- TCA cycle
- pyruvate carboxylase (PC) converting pyruvate to OAA (anaplerosis)
- inner mitochondrial transport proteins

**Enhanced exression**
- pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1), which inhibits PDH

## Mitochondrial metabolism is impaired in diabetic islets

- We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM)

Under control conditions, glucose signal is dominated by mitochondrial NADH produced by the activity of the TCA cycle.

The failure of glucose to elevate NAD(P)H in diabetic β-cells is not due to NAD(P)+ depletion and that basal mitochondrial metabolism remains at least partially intact in diabetic β-cells

Failure of NADH to increase in response to acute glucose elevation is predicted to result in a smaller increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ψm).

- The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) at basal (2 mM) glucose and the increase stimulated by 20 mM glucose were both substantially lower in diabetic islets than in control islets.
- Attenuated ATP synthase activity was also observed, as indicated by the reduced respiratory response to metabolic inhibition by oligomycin.
- No difference in mitochondrial leak.

### Effects of diabetes on metabolic pathways

Unlike most cells, β-cells lack the lactate transporter MCT135, and have reduced expression of lactate dehydrogenase, so that little excess glucose is metabolised to lactate.

We therefore measured the rate of glucose utilisation as the release of tritium H2O from tritium glucose.

Glucose utilisation was significantly reduced in diabetic islets (by ~25%), despite the increase in expression of glycolytic genes and proteins. Both glycolytic and mitochondrial glucose metabolism are reduced in diabetic islets.
- excess glucose is converted to glycogen
- Upregulation of fatty acid (FA) synthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and cholesterol pathways

### Metabolic tracing of glucose metabolism in INS-1 cells

INS-1 832/13 insulin-secreting β-cell line for these in vitro studies as greater sensitivity can be obtained. They were cultured at 5 or 25 mM glucose for 48 h.

Hyperglycaemia-induced changes:
- upregulation of glycolytic proteins
- downregulation of mitochondrial proteins
- glucose-stimulated oxygen consumption was reduced

**Labelling**
INS-1 cells were cultured at either 5 mM glucose (lowG cells) or 25 mM glucose (highG cells) for 48 h and then stimulated for 30 min with 2 or 20 mM D-[U-13C]-glucose.

Significant large increase in pyruvate (with no change in label incorporation) and suggests a block in pyruvate metabolism.

## Discussion

Glycolysis was among the most significantly upregulated pathways in diabetic islets.

Diabetes resulted in the coordinated suppression of many TCA cycle enzymes.

A number of genes responsible for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis are downregulated in T2D individuals.

Our analysis of mitochondrial function indicated that both mitochondrial coupling efficiency and oxygen consumption were impaired in diabetic βV59M islets.

In diabetic islets glucose oxidation is very substantially reduced. The fluxes goes to glyconogenesis, pentose phosphate, polyol (fructose), and FA synthesis pathways.
