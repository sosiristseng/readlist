## Introduction

Mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested to play a central role in metabolic diseases such as diabetes and in a number of chronic conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease and aging.

Autophagy when
- apoptosis
- organelles no longer needed (too much ER, damaged mitochondria)
- under starvation to provide nutrients

Mitochondria exist in networks that are continuously remodeled through fusion and fission. The mitochondrial population within a cell will be homogenous in protein content and, consequently, in function, within ~45 min. Due to fusion events.

The frequency of fusion events in COS7 and INS1 cells is once every ~5-20 min per mitochondrion.

In an unstressed individual beta cell, a population of 300 mitochondria will generate 500-1000 fission events per hour, but less than 100 mitochondria–containing autophagosomes per hour. (<10~20% of fission events)

Mitochondrial fragmentation, which can be induced by various insults, is a common stress response that permits the segregation and elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria from the web.


## Selective fusion

Depolarized mitochondria are barred from fusion.

Non-fusing mitochondria are depolarized by ~7 mV compared to average Δψm and have approximately 50% less OPA1 compared to the rest of mitochondrial web.

The l-isoforms of OPA1 undergo cleavage (or degradation) under mitochondrial depolarization or depletion in ATP.

But certain mtDNA mutations have been shown to spread across the mitochondrial network through fusion events.
