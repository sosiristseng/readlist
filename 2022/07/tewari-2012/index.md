## Introduction

The mitochondrial adenine nucleotide (AdN) pool (AdN = ATP +ADP +AMP) is regulated by ATP and Pi transport through the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (APC). This carrier facilitates an electroneutral exchange between `MgATP2−` and `HPO42−`, with nonproductive exchanges of the preferred substrates. 

Transport via the APC is slow. (4–5 nmol/min/mg vs. inorganic phosphate carrier (PiC) can exceed 3000 nmol/min/mg) 

## Proposed mechanism of ATP/Pi exchange via the APC

- ordered bi-bi for heteroexchange and random bi-bi for homoexchange of ATP and Pi
- assuming that the substrate binding to the carrier is much faster than the translocation rates
- Hill regulated by calcium
- Parameters: see [table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471468/table/tbl2/)

## Results

## Discussion

This model captures the important features of the APC apparent from the available kinetic data
1. saturating ATP efflux induced by external [Pi]
2. saturating ATP efflux induced by external [ATP]
3. ATP influx inhibition due to competition between external [ATP] and external [Pi]
4. nonsaturating ATP efflux within physiological range of matrix [ATP]

The proposed mechanism of the APC incorporates Pi homoexchange because the available experimental data could not be explained without incorporating the Pi homoexchange in the mechanism.

At least two Ca2+ ions (based on the value of hill coef `nH`; see [table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3471468/table/tbl2/)) must bind with the APC to modulate the ATP influx/efflux rates.
