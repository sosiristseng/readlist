The protonmotive Q-cycle Ubiquinol oxidation at the Qo site is the first and most critical step in the protonmotive Q-cycle. Different mechanisms describe the bifurcation of electrons during ubiquinol oxidation and the generation of superoxide at the Qo site The superoxide production at complex III at Qo site is enhanced upon addition of the Qi site inhibitor antimycin A. The ‘distal’ and ’tight’ Qo site inhibitor stigmatellin completely abolishes the superoxide production while binding of a ‘proximal’ Qo site inhibitor like myxothiazol caused only a partial reduction. Factors and respiratory chain complexes with an impact on the superoxide generation by complex III ROS production strongly depends on the mitochondrial membrane potential. The membrane potential alone and not the protonmotive force determines the rate of superoxide production. The membrane potential severely slows down electron transfer from heme bL to heme bH thereby promoting a more reduced state of heme bL which then increases superoxide generation. The redox state of the Q pool is another factor. There is a bell-shaped curve for antimycin A-dependent superoxide generation. The results indicated semireverse mode is the dominant way to produce ROS in complex III. Topology of ROS release from the Qo site and implications for redox signaling Complex III releases half of the superoxide into the intermembrane space (and the cytoplasm), another half into the matrix, while complex I releases superoxide exclusively into the matrix. Oxidized cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase form an efficient scavenging system for superoxide. Besides, some SOD1 is present in the intermembrane space. Bleier L, Dröse S.

It is both a Krebs cycle enzyme and a member of the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETS). The flavoprotein subunit SDHA contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) covalently bound to one of the active sites. The SDHB subunit contains three iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs): [2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S]. Subunits C and D (SDHC and SDHD) contain a single transmembrane cytochrome b heme. In mammalian mitochondria, 11 sites including SDH are known to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Complex III is commonly argued as the dominate source of ROS under resting condition, whereas complex I is attributed as the primary source of ROS under many pathological conditions, including ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the role of complex II is less certain. Recent studies have shown that SDH may significantly contribute to total mitochondrial ROS production in a variety of physiological and pathological settings. Complex I and III are inhibited Skeletal muscle mitochondria respiring on succinate. ROS from SDH promotes the pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and differentiation of helper T cells. Unfortunately, experimental studies on the origin of ROS production by SDH are inconclusive. Our analysis of the model presented herein reveals that although the FAD site does produce ROS, the primary source is the [3Fe-4S] ISC under normal physiological conditions.

Done another experiment to verify the model. Decylubiquinone can directly reduce oxygen and amplify resorufin fluorescence. At the lower succinate concentration, adding DQ resulted in a dramatic drop in ROS production by SDH. This is due to a decrease in both the succinate and QH2 concentrations and an increase in fumarate and Q concentrations catalyzed by SDH. The result was predicted by the model. In contrast, the addition of DQ when the succinate concentration is higher (5 mm) leads to a surprising increase in ROS production. Because Decylubiquinone can directly reduce oxygen and amplify resorufin (ROS reporter) fluorescence. The model was also corroborated using the experimental data from Grivennikova et al. Model corroboration of ROS production and SDH kinetics Model analysis demonstrates that ROS production by SDH occurs in both the “forward” and “reverse” modes. It does not matter where the electrons come from: either succinate in the forward mode or QH2 in the reverse mode. Model prediction of site-specific ROS production when the enzyme oxidation state is determined by the Q pool redox state. When the Qp site is inhibited, superoxide derived from the flavin radical is the primary source of ROS. When the flavin site is inhibited, most of the total ROS originates from the [3Fe-4S] iron0-sulfur cluster.

Model simulations show that lumping together the complexes N1b, N4, N5, N6a, and N6b gives similar results as the full model but reduces the number of state variables from 1536 to 96. Each state of complex III is described as an array describing the reduction and binding states of its functional parts: cytochrome c1 (c1), the iron sulfur cluster (Fe-S), the binding site for ubisemiquinone at p-site (SQp), the low b-type heme (bL), the high b-type heme (bH), and the binding site for ubisemiquinone at n-site (SQn). It is assumed that electrons are transferred from ubiquinol at p-side in a two-step process, first reducing the Fe-S and binding of SQp and afterward reducing bL, and release of Qp.

Our model simulations showed a steady decline of the mitochondrial NADH level with progressive KGDHC inhibition, whereas up to 95% inhibition of the aconitase had virtually no impact. A reduced NADH content does not translate linearly to reduced energy production. Aconitase shows the highest susceptibility towards ROS, because of its sulfur-iron complex, but aconitase inhibition remains irrelevant if it does not exceed 90 percent. KGDHC is tightly bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane and might be part of a citric acid cycle super-complex. It binds to complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which might make it a prominent target of ROS. Thus, ROS is one possible reason for KGDHC deficiency. Since akg is in equilibrium with glutamate by a deaminase reaction, this might lead to glutamate poisoning, another pathological feature associate with KGDHC inhibition.

This study also distinguished two different classes of fusion, one that allows complete mixing of matrix components and another that allows only partial mixing (transient fusion).

Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial motility plays a key role in each of the steps associated with mitochondrial quality control, including fusion, fission, biogenesis, and lysosomal function. A previous computational study (Twig et al.) of the effects of fusion, fission, and autophagy on mitochondrial health in the presence of ROS-mediated damage demonstrated that selective fusion and autophagy can result in stable average health of the mitochondrial population. Here, we present a computational model that incorporates the spatial dynamics of mitochondrial networks into the quality control cycle of the mitochondrial population.

When the number of mitochondria in the cell increases, the total propensity for fusion and fission events will rise and this correspondingly leads to a faster mixing of nucleoids. The model simulations were done using a steady state nucleoid population of 320 (or 80 mitochondria). Slower mtDNA mixing coincided with higher mutation burden variability among cells Imperfect mixing of mtDNA nucleoids can give rise to additional variability in the outcome of mitophagy events Simulations of mitochondrial fusion-fission without mtDNA turnover Simulations of mitochondrial fusion-fission with neutral mutations Model simulations showed that the total mutation burden in the cell population increased with time. Amplification of clonal expansion by retrograde signalling when mitochondrial fusion-fission is slow In the model simulations, lowering either fusion or fission individually by 500 times from those for τ = 1 day, led to slower fusion-fission process and mixing of nucleoids. Mitochondria with a lower membrane potential have been shown to be prevented from fusion with others and preferentially autophagosized (selective degradation), acting as a mechanism to selectively remove deleterious mtDNA mutations. We have ignored the occurrence of de novo mutations. The model also did not account for possible interactions between mtDNA turnover and mitochondrial fusion-fission,that are independent of mtDNA mutation burden and retrograde signalling.

At rest, $\\ce{[Ca^2+]}_m$ and $\\ce{[Ca^2+]}_c$ are similar, in the 100 nM range. In non-excitable cells, these oscillations are due to a cyclical exchange of Ca between the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), through the biphasic regulation of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) by cytosolic Ca. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) drives cytosolic Ca to the mitochondrial matrix via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). Extrusion of Ca2+ out of mitochondria occurs through both a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and a H+-Ca2+ exchanger. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and two rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle, isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, are up-regulated by mitochondrial Ca. Cytosolic Ca also directly influences mitochondrial metabolism as a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), the aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC), is stimulated by modest increases in cytosolic Ca. Given the complexity and highly non-linear character of Ca2+ and mitochondrial dynamics ( not the fission/fusion dynamics ), it is useful to resort to computational modelling to clarify their interplay. This model focues on calcium signaling affecting mitochondrial metabolism. We found that a reversible Ca2+ leak between the cytosol and the mitochondria, which could correspond to the low conductance mode of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, was necessary to account for a number of experimental observations. The phase relationship between Ca2+ peaks in the cytosol, the ER, and the mitochondria31 was investigated in details.

The long-tail behaviour displayed by p(s) was in accordance with recent work suggesting that mitochondrial networks operate near a percolation phase transition.

Any drop in Δp, and hence ΔGp, is immediately sensed by the glycolytic pathway to increase the flux to restore Δp and ATP levels. In beta-cells, over the range 140-100 mV, the endogenous proton leak was roughly ohmic and exerted a high level of control over respiration and Δp The activity of muscle contration is controlled by flux (ATP turnover) rather than ATP/ADP ratio, and the opposite in beta-cells.

It alters the cardiac action potential and refractory period, might contribute to an arrhythmogenic substrate during ischemia-reperfusion KATP channels are directly gated by intracellular ATP and Magnesium adenosine diphosphate (MgADP) and have low probability of opening under normal conditions. When ATP/ADP ratio decreases, open probability of these channels increases, setting membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Substrate deprivation or localized laser flash can trigger cellwide oscillations or collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential in isolated cardiomyocytes, which can be interrupted or prevented either by employing ROS scavengers or applying ligands of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, which are known inhibitors of an inner membrane anion channel (IMAC) The mechanism involves mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggering the activation of IMAC in a positive feedback loop causing energy dissipation and the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Uncoupled mitochondria consume intracellular ATP stores, driving the activation of the KATP channel (11) and consequently producing significant changes in the action potential duration (APD). The processes cannot be easily understood without a comprehensive model as a tool, and technically very difficult to simultaneously measure metabolites, ions, metabolic fluxes, and currents in experiments on cardiomyocytes.

The increased K+ conductance tends to lock the resting membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK). Mitochondrial uncoupling accelerates KATP current activation because the drop in ΔΨm causes the ATP synthase to run in reverse, thus consuming cytoplasmic ATP and decreasing the phosphorylation potential. During the phase of mitochondrial depolarization, the AP shortened by almost 75% (Fig. 4) and the intracellular Ca2+ transient amplitude (not shown) and force production decreased. A feedforward effect of pacing frequency on the mitochondrial oscillator was also observed. Michailova and McCulloch (33) and Michailova et al. (34) further explored the role of free Mg2+, MgATP, and MgADP on IK,ATP, ICa, and [Ca2+]i in a canine cell model. Either increases in free cytosolic Mg2+ (0.2–5 mM) with fixed Mg-nucleotide concentrations, or decreases in the ATP/ADP ratio with fixed total Mg2+, could activate IK,ATP and systematically change the APD, Ca2+ current, and the Ca2+ transients (35).

The state 4 respiration by suspensions of isolated mitochondria is due to isolation-induced leak(s) in energy coupling. The leak is positively related to the energy level and oxygen levels. Muscles of insects, hummingbirds, and humans can reach metabolic rates from 50 to more than 100 times their resting rates, and ATP is efficiently produced at both conditions. In well-coupled mitochondria (Q = 300 mV), nearly 100% of the oxidase can be in the form of the intermediate, V, consistent with spectral change (high-spin ferric form to the low-spin ferric form) in the experiments. In uncoupled mitochondria, the concentration is vanishingly small, and this would be expected for preparations of isolated cytochrome oxidase as well The oxygen dependence of respiration described by the steady-state rate expression for the model is consistent with the behavior of isolated mitochondria and intact cells The increases in free ADP and AMP, however, are large enough (Fig. 7) to cause substantial alterations in metabolism (e.g. AMPK pathway) ","date":"2020-10-23","objectID":"/readlist/2020/10/wilson-2014/:4:0","series":["Heart modeling","ETC review"],"tags":["complex 4","mitochondria","electron transport chain"],"title":"Wilson 2014 : Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase: mechanism of action and role in regulating oxidative phosphorylation","uri":"/readlist/2020/10/wilson-2014/#discussion"},{"categories":[],"content":" Appendix ASteady-state kinetic expression for oxygen reduction by cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 1).

The presence or absence of phospholamban is not relevant here The density of cardiac SERCA pumps in mouse is estimated to be higher than that of rabbit. In the modeling process, this difference in Vmax between different data sets is accounted for by normalizing all the data to a single reference point Parameter sensitivity The parameter with the greatest influence in the model is n, the number of H+ that are counter-transported for each Ca2+. Taking together the high sensitivity of this parameter and the prediction of n = 2 (which is consistent with the literature).

The parameter Krel2 (crel in the original TNNP model), was also predicted poorly, most likely because it is partially redundant with the parameter Krel1 The surprise in our simulations was the poor prediction of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current, GKr. But preditions about slow delayed rectifier, GKs, was accurate. Overlapping in function was suggested. Two important factors influencing the accuracy of the conductance predictions are the number and quality of the outputs.

Under basal conditions (absence of β-adrenergic stimulation), IKs reduction had almost no effect on human and dog APs, but it severely prolonged the guinea pig AP. In the presence of β-adrenergic stimulation, IKs reduction affected all species to substantial degree. Rate-dependent INaK changes play a major role in APD rate dependence in human and dog. The role of INaK is secondary to [Na+] accumulation at fast rates. For guinea pig, IKs dominates APD rate dependence via its open-state accumulation at fast rate, while in human and dog under β-adrenergic stimulation, accumulation of IKs in available reserve closed states is important for proper AP repolarization and APD shortening at fast rate. EAD formation due to delayed rectifier K+ current block at slow pacing rates is species dependent. did not include mouse or rat APs in this comparison: AP morphology, physiological heart rate, and rate dependence in these smaller mammalian species are set apart due to lack of plateau phase and a different cellular ion-channel profile Human and dog (as well as rabbit) repolarization is due mainly to IKr, which is not rate dependent.

Hz) and human (1 Hz). APD in mouse ventricular myocytes is also considerably shorter (APD50 ∼ 4.5 ms in mice versus ∼200 ms in rabbits and ∼300–400 ms in humans. In mice, the peak value of Ca2+ transient occurs after almost complete repolarization of action potential In larger species, such as rabbit, time scaling of the action potential, [Ca2+]i and contraction force transients is different Mouse ventricular myocytes, unlike other species, demonstrate biphasic frequency dependence of intracellular [Ca2+]i transient and peak force The model for an epicardial cell was also able to reproduce this physiological phenomenon. However, our model for the endocardial cell does not show biphasic behavior in the frequency-dependence of both peak [Ca2+]i transients and peak contraction force, but at least qualitatively, reproduced saturation and even decrease in sarcomere shortening and contraction force amplitude at 4-Hz stimulation the endocardial cells demonstrate significantly larger [Ca2+]i transients, and our modeling predicts larger contraction force and shortening in these ventricular myocytes. Simulations with variable sarcomere length produce significantly smaller contraction force than the simulations with constant sarcomere length despite the same time course and amplitude of [Ca2+]i transient during twitch The only difference between Rice Models 4 and 5 is the modulation of the k− ltrpn rate by generated force. Because Model 4 and Model 5 yielded an approximately equal description of myocyte contraction, we implemented Model 4 in our electrophysiological model, as Model 5 led to unstable solutions.

Experiments: SOD concentrations, values reported are ~0.5 μM. ROS reportedly ranged from 0.15 to 11% of the O2 consumption flux The emergence of complex oscillatory behavior within the “edge” region. Oscillations occurred in a restricted region of the parametric space defined by the SODs and ROS production in the respiratory chain. the higher the antioxidant capacity of the periplasm-cytoplasm, the larger the parametric space compatible with functional behavior. As a result when Cu, Zn SOD concentration increases, the ability of the two compartments to tolerate higher mitochondrial ROS production is enhanced, even at low concentrations of MnSOD. The inverse amplitude vs. frequency relationship was demonstrated previously (Aon et al., 2006) and is confirmed by the present, more elaborate, ME-R model. Specifically, the 3D phase space projection of the dynamics of H2O2 released as a function of other energetic variables (ΔΨm, succinate) demonstrates the dynamic-functional interrelationships between processes occurring within the same time scale (seconds).

We assume that substrate and product binding only depend on the redox state of the nearest redox center. Only consider the redox states for the FMN, Fe-S cluster N2, and SQ. Binding polynomials to calculate the fraction a given state is bound with a given reactant. Midpoint potentials are dependent on pH. All midpoint potentials were taken from the literature or directly fit to redox-titration data. Since electron transfer between these states is fast (O(μs)), we model these substates as rapidly interconverting species governed by the thermodynamics of electron transfer. The state transitions follow a 2e- reduction, 2e- oxidation or 1e-oxidation of the enzyme by NADH, Q or O2, or O2, respectively In order to apply the rapid equilibrium assumption, both the substrate and the product must be present to avoid a mathematical singularity but some conditions are NAD=0, so NAD/NADH are not in rapid equlibrium in this model. The rate of electron input via superoxide or hydrogen peroxide is negligible and can be ignored; however, they are included in the model to maintain thermodynamic consistency. The steady-state equation for the five-state model was analytically solved using MATLAB’s symbolic toolbox. Most of the data are from the same source, bovine heart mitochondria, with a few data from rat heart mitochondria.

In the reverse mode, superoxide is generated at both the Q reductase and NADH oxidase sites after QH2 is oxidized, with two sites contributing equally. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the fully reduced FMN in state 3 The ability of a SQ to reduce oxygen to for superoxide in Complex I is still debated. There must be a high ΔΨ and a highly reduced Q pool (RET condition) in order for an appreciable amount of SQ to form The model best reproduced the data when superoxide from the Fe-S cluster N2 was excluded. FMN radical is only a significant source of ROS when Q is absent or Q reductase site inhibitors are present. This is consistent with the findings of Kussmaul and Hirst. Model simulations of NADH oxidation rates as a function of Q pool redox state at various fixed Δp’s The model is hypersensitive to Δp, and at Δp\u003c100 mV the rate of NADH oxidation is increasingly insensitive to the Q pool redox state and only depends on the NAD(H) pool redox state. We do not have sufficient data to conclusively determine how the energetic cost of proton pumping is distributed in the reaction mechanism. Model simulation of ROS stoichiometric coefficient, n, NADH oxidation, and ROS production as a function of ΔΨ, matrix pH, %NADH, and %Q At low ΔΨ and pH, n is small and nearly all of the electrons from NADH reach their intended target, Q. As both ΔΨ and pH increase, not only does n increase, but also, the amount of RET increases as well. The model predicts that ROS are produced in greater excess during RET versus FE. The fraction of electrons reducing oxygen becomes quite significant when both the NAD(H) and Q pools are highly reduced. Pumping mechanism that is directly coupled to the reduction of the SQ in the reaction scheme is thermodynamically and kinetically feasible.

In biochemical thermodynamics it is more convenient to take the apparent equilibrium constant and transformed thermodynamic properties of reactants like ATP to be functions of ionic strength in addition to temperature and pH.
